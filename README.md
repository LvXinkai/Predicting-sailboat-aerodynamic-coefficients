Please download the complete project first, and install all dependencies according to the 'requirements.txt' file.
The dataset is stored in the dataset folder, and the trained model parameters are stored in the checkpoints folder.MSR
1. MSR UNet位于net_model中，OAMM则位于con_coffes_mapping_model中，
2. The pre-trained parameters are stored in the 'checkpoints' folder.
3. MSR UNet is in the 'net_model', OAMM is in 'con_coffes_mapping_model'
4. For MSR UNet, run start_testing.py for testing, run strat_training.py for training.
5. For OAMM, run OAMM_test.py for testing, run OAMM_train.py for training.

Please note that the testing files for both networks have been configured with the parameters trained by us, and can be executed directly.
